    <h2> From the author - </h2>
    <h5>My daughter Namu is really a gifted artist. She started drawing at a very early age. And as a first-time mother,
        I was so obsessed with her drawings that I used to save all her artwork whether it came from the daycare, or
        something she would draw after listening to a story, watching a cartoon, after having any experiences or
        anything she would draw in her school. Since I had a huge collection, I wanted to share it with the world so
        that they can get some ideas and get their kids started on a similar journey. It's not just about drawing, it is
        about any passion that any child may have. It could be recording small and beautiful moments of their life, for
        example - when they first started playing a musical instrument, started writing, learning a language or picking
        up multiple languages. Not every child is the same, but one thing I am sure everyone will agree with "Every
        child is gifted", we just have to be open-minded about it, and wait patiently to see what is special for our
        child.
