        <h1><strong>Namami Sehgal</strong></h1>
        Namami Sehgal writes kids books. She lives in Toronto suburbs with her husband and 2 daughters. She just
        launched her very first book "Namu learns to draw" and is enjoying the present moment.
        <br>
        In theory, she is working on her next fiction book series. In reality, she is out there in the woods jogging,
        playing with her 2 cute princesses, teaching them some new games or reading books for them.
